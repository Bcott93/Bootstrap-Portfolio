# Bootstrap-Portfolio

The task was to create a portfolio of my work as a student while using Bootstrap.

## The Goal

The objective was to recreate our previously created Project-Gallery in Bootstrap. 

The end product needed to include:
    - A nav bar
    - A bootstrap nav menu
    - A section showing a picture or avatar and my name
    - A grid showing my projects
    - A link to any deployed applications

We needed to show understanding of minimizing media queries to complete our tasks.
